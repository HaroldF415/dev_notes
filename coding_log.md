# Coding Log

## 09/23/23

It has been months since I last sat down in front of a computer monitor and typed on a keyboard. Due to certain life choices, I decided to take a step back from programming and prioritize my family and, more importantly, myself. It was a tough decision to halt my programming journey, but I have no regrets. Patience has never been my strong suit, and when I rush things, they often turn out sloppy. So, this marks the beginning of my coding journey once more. One step at a time, but with a clearer focus on my goals as a Software Engineer.
