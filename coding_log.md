# Coding Log

## 09/23/23

It has been months since I last sat down in front of a computer monitor and typed on a keyboard. Due to certain life choices, I decided to take a step back from programming and prioritize my family and, more importantly, myself. It was a tough decision to halt my programming journey, but I have no regrets. Patience has never been my strong suit, and when I rush things, they often turn out sloppy. So, this marks the beginning of my coding journey once more. One step at a time, but with a clearer focus on my goals as a Software Engineer.

### "Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel DISAPPOINTMENT. On the road to achieving your DREAMS, you must apply DISCIPLINE, but more importantly, CONSISTENCY. Because, without COMMITMENT, you'll never START. But, without DISCIPLINE, you'll never finish." - Denzel Washington

As I begin this journey again, I will set some goals for myself, something that I had not done previously. Becoming a software engineer has been a dream of mine for some time now, and I think in order to get there, it is a continuous journey. These goals will help give me direction this time around.
