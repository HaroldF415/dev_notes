# Coding Log

## 09/23/23

It has been months since I last sat down in front of a computer monitor and typed on a keyboard. Due to certain life choices, I decided to take a step back from programming and prioritize my family and, more importantly, myself. It was a tough decision to halt my programming journey, but I have no regrets. Patience has never been my strong suit, and when I rush things, they often turn out sloppy. So, this marks the beginning of my coding journey once more. One step at a time, but with a clearer focus on my goals as a Software Engineer.

### "Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel DISAPPOINTMENT. On the road to achieving your DREAMS, you must apply DISCIPLINE, but more importantly, CONSISTENCY. Because, without COMMITMENT, you'll never START. But, without DISCIPLINE, you'll never finish." - Denzel Washington

As I begin this journey again, I will set some goals for myself, something that I had not done previously. Becoming a software engineer has been a dream of mine for some time now, and I think in order to get there, it is a continuous journey. These goals will help give me direction this time around.

## Software Engineering Goals

1. Programming Proficiency
2. Problem Solving
3. Software Design
4. Version Control
5. Testing
6. Database Knowledge
7. Web Development
8. Backend Development
9. DevOps Practices
10. Cloud Services
11. Security Awareness
12. Agile and Scrum
13. Soft Skills
14. Continuous Learning
15. Open Source Contribution
16. Networking
17. Personal Projects

Today, I decided to focus on the fundamentals of algorithms. I believe that it is my weakest skill as a software engineer. While I can come up with solutions quickly when I write code, I often find myself asking why I solved a problem in a particular way after completing the task. I believe that with a solid foundation in algorithms, I can finally stop second-guessing myself and have confidence in the solutions I provide.

Continuing from my study session last night, I will begin by reviewing the information I absorbed. Most importantly, the first few pages of the textbook provided me with insights into the vast knowledge it will impart. Two key takeaways from my previous study session are the notions that algorithms should be regarded as a form of technology. This is because they play a pivotal role in driving innovation and can confer a competitive advantage in the real world.

The term "innovation" is significant here, as advancements and optimizations in algorithm design often pave the way for breakthroughs in various technology fields, such as artificial intelligence, data science, cryptography, and more. These innovations, in part, fuel and propel technological progress forward.

The second takeaway is that there are computational problems in computer science that are both in the complexity class NP [ Nondeterministic Polynomial-Time ] and are believed to be among the most challenging problems in terms of finding efficient algorithms to solve them. One line from that textbook that stood out to me was:

"The set of NP-complete problems has the remarkable property that if an efficient algorithm exists for any one of them, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them."
