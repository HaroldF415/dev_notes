## [Sum of Digits / Digital Root](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541c8630095125aba6000c00)

### Problem

In this kata, you must create a digital root function. A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.
