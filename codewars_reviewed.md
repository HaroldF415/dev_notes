## [Sum of Digits / Digital Root](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541c8630095125aba6000c00)

### Problem

In this kata, you must create a digital root function. A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

## Programming Concepts To Review Before Attempting This Problem

- Data Types

  - Integers and how to manipulate them

- Control Structures

  - ForLoops and WhileLoops

- String Manipulation

  - How to convert a string to an integer and vice versa

- Recursion

  - Use recursion to continue reducing the sum of the digits until a single digit is produced

- Functions
  - Defining a function to encapsulate the logic of adding the digits and reducing them to a single digit

## Breakdown

- Let's define the function name for this problem. We'll call it digitalRoot.
  - This function will take in one parameter, `n`, which will be an integer as a parameter.

```js
const digitalRoot = (n) => {
  // Your code here
};
```
