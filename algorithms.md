# Algorithms

There is a book I bought years ago when I was first starting to learn COMP SCI. Eveytime I would start it I would give up before reaching the 2nd chapter. This time around I will do better.

Name: Introduction to Algorithms [3rd Edition]
Authors: Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

## Foundations

### "We should consider algorithms as a technology."

Just reading the introduction to this book I'm hit with a barrage of information that almost makes no sense to me. But I will write them down in this markdown file and find out what it all means.

Algorithms in this book will be presented in "pseudocode". For clarity's sake let's define these vocabulary terms:

Algorithm: a list of well-defined steps that provide instructions on how to accomplish a specific task.

Pseudocode: a way to express the logic of an algorithm in a more human-readable and informal manner.

Pseudocode serves as an intermediate step between a high-level description of an algorithm and actual code written in a specific programming language.
