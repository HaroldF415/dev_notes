It's been over 10 years since I've started my journey to become a Software Engineer. I've pursued this goal through college education, online courses, participation in a coding bootcamp, and extensive self-studying. Despite all my efforts, breaking into this tech-world has proven to be a consistent challenge. To be completely transparent, over the years I have taken breaks pursuing this goal. One of these break periods occurred when the pandemic hit. The world as I knew it stopped dead in it's tracks, it was at this point in time that I seized the chance to reasses and prioritize my own life. A family, that is what I wanted, my partner and I agreed that with the world stopping so breifly we could take the liberty to start having children. Once I started down that path, I needed to take the necessary steps to become independent and move out from my parent's home. I needed to create my own path at the age of 30.

When I attended college, I majored in Computer Science and Information Technology. It's clich√© to say that I've always had a thing for technology, but there is no way around it. My parents got me a computer at the age of 5, and even though I don't remember the specific type they got for me, I do recall the very first game I played on it: Prince of Persia from 1989 (the year I was born). I feel I must include that Computer Science was not my very first choice. I started college back in 2008, majoring in Liberal Arts, and then switched to International Business. I didn't like either of them, and I was having too much fun with a fraternity I had just joined, which inevitably led me to abandon college altogether.
