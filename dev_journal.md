It's been over 10 years since I've started my journey to become a Software Engineer. I've pursued this goal through college education, online courses, participation in a coding bootcamp, and extensive self-studying. Despite all my efforts, breaking into this tech-world has proven to be a consistent challenge. To be completely transparent, over the years I have taken breaks pursuing this goal. One of these break periods occurred when the pandemic hit. The world as I knew it stopped dead in its tracks, it was at this point in time that I seized the chance to reassess and prioritize my own life. A family, that is what I wanted, my partner and I agreed that with the world stopping so briefly we could take the liberty to start having children. Once I started down that path, I needed to take the necessary steps to become independent and move out from my parent's home. I needed to create my own path at the age of 30.

When I attended college, I majored in Computer Science and Information Technology. It's cliché to say that I've always had a thing for technology, but there is no way around it. My parents got me a computer at the age of 5, and even though I don't remember the specific type they got for me, I do recall the very first game I played on it: Prince of Persia from 1989 (the year I was born). I feel I must include that Computer Science was not my very first choice. I started college back in 2008, majoring in Liberal Arts, and then switched to International Business. I didn't like either of them, and I was having too much fun with a fraternity I had just joined, which inevitably led me to abandon college altogether.

### Just a Programmer...

It's been two days since I've really sat down and worked on blogging about my journey to become a Software Engineer. In the previous blog, I gave a little background on how it all started and also provided a reason as to why it might be taking me so long to become one. I know that overall, if there are any faults, they lie with me. Writing these blogs has helped me to realize that now. But even so, I must pursue this goal of mine. I like to write code. I like peeping behind the veil of programs. I don't even know if that is the correct term for it. What makes them work? What breaks them? And ultimately, what makes them not break?

There are two core memories that are always replaying in my mind, and I feel I should share them here because they keep screaming at me that this is why you want to become a programmer. When I was a child, I don't remember exactly what toys I was playing with, but I do remember something my father said that still resonates with me to this day. It wasn't something negative, at least I don't think so. He said that I like to destroy things. I'd like to think that what he meant is: I like to deconstruct things to understand how they work from the inside out. I've constantly found myself tinkering with things whether it be in technology, life, or even within myself. What makes things work, think, act the way they do? What is the root cause of it all? Is there something in between cause and effect?

The second core memory would be when I was playing with clay. This was when I was visiting my native country, Peru. I believe I was trying to build a car out of clay with my cousins, and my aunt came in and mentioned that I was a 'detallista' [Spanish], a person that is detail-oriented. I remember her saying that because I was working on the inside of the car. The steering wheel, the pedals, and most of the front console. I wanted it to be like a real car, but smaller. I don't quite remember what my cousins were working on, but I do remember that my aunt came up to me and said that. This, combined with what my father said, has played a major role in my actions throughout life. When building a PC, I would stare at the motherboard and see how all the circuits connected with each other. Although I think everyone that builds a PC does this at some point, but I think I stared a little bit longer than most, just in awe of how it all came together.

I think I misspoke before about having two core memories because, as I am writing this, another core memory comes to mind —- one that is very dear to me because it involves cooking with my cousins. Again, this was back in Peru, but it was either around the same time as my previous memory or when I was a bit older. My cousins and I were in the kitchen preparing a Peruvian dish called "[Papa Rellena](https://perudelights.com/how-to-make-papa-rellena-step-by-step/)". This delicious dish requires for a light covering of flour before frying the potato. In my naive attempt to speed up the process, I added the flour to the mashed potato mixture all together. This led to my cousin telling me: 'How is the flour supposed to cook when it's in the mixture, when only the outside of the potato is going to be fried?' This is a core memory because I remember her telling me consistently not to do that. She ended the conversation by telling my aunt that 'I always do what I'm not supposed to,' or 'If someone tells me not to do something, I do it even more.' I hold on to this memory because it's true. I like to do the opposite of what others say. Two main reasons, though, and they are very true. One to find out for myself what would happen if I do it and the other to find out how people react to it or how I react to it afterward (there's that thing again about cause and effect). From what I can remember about myself, I've always been like this. I want to know what happens, why it happens, how it happens.

I'm writing this in the hopes that people will understand me better but most importantly I'm doing this to understand myself better and why I do the things that I do. Maybe I'm just meant to be a programmer on the side and not really become a Software Engineer with a job like everyone else. My journey has been long, with hurdles along the way, some of which I'm thankful for and some not. But I will keep pursuing this because it's something that I'm passionate about, I like it. Right now as, I'm thinking of how to write this my mind is telling me to write about how I view things while I'm driving. I'm constantly checking the mirrors and looking at the cars, measuring their speed and distance relative to mind, and constantly thinking how their trajectory might affect. Just watching the road and then seeing something slightly move out of place in the rearview mirror sends my mind into a spin of possibilities and options I have while driving. I'd like to think everyone is like this when driving but I might be wrong in that assumption. Even while at work I'm like this, I see one thing out of place and again my mind is sent into a whirlwind of possibilities good and bad. Therefore I must correct that issue otherwise my mind is stuck on that specific thing that must be fixed.

I think I will conclude this blog by mentioning that I was diagnosed with ADHD several years ago. Despite there being many different opinions on this medical condition, I like to believe that the things I do, say and how I think are entirely my own. They ultimately come from me and I'm responsible for them. I cannot with a clear conscious blame my struggles on a medical condition. At least that is not who I want to be. This realization comes from the many conversations I've had over the years with my wife and sister, whom I deeply love and appreciate. They've taken it upon themselves to really understand my medical condition and have always been there for me. My wife in particular, she's seen me at my most personal lowest moments, she's seen me break down and with her help, I've always managed to get back up. It's taken some time to terms with this, and it's even harder to write about this as I feel my eyes get watery, but even if I don't make it as a Software Engineer with a real job, I think I will be happy with myself to just be a programmer.

### What is HTMX?

Today's blog will focus on getting out of my comfort zone just a little:

Reading an article related to tech.

In my journey to become a well-rounded programmer, I've decided to take it upon myself to read an article about tech that I've previously bookmarked and read it. I find myself constantly bookmarking articles and telling myself I'll get back to them. But I never do, it's time to change that cycle. Doing this will force me to become a person of habit and discipline, something that I have been lacking. Doing this will deepen my understanding of the tech world, which, I believe, involves more than just writing code in front of the computer.

So lets begin, the article is:

[Why you should choose HTMX for your next project](https://dev.to/turculaurentiu91/why-you-should-choose-htmx-for-your-next-project-o7j) by [Turcu Laurentiu](https://github.com/turculaurentiu91)

The author starts by claiming that HTMX can be considered as a replacement for React. Since React is the only JavaScript library I have tinkered with the title of this article peaked my interest.

Let's start by finding out what is [HTMX](https://refine.dev/blog/what-is-htmx/)?

- HTMX is a modern JavaScript Library that allows us to have seamless client-server communication.
- HTMX also simplifies the behavior of web pages by allowing them to update their content dynamically.
- HTMX uses specific HTML attributes to define how elements on a particular webpage interact with the server.

## LinkedIn Profile Update

It's slowly starting to hit me that it's December, another year is coming to an end, another year that I have not achieved my goal to become a Software Engineer. At 34 years old, I've worked several odd jobs, most out of necessity to maintain financial stability for my family and myself. Right now, the job that I currently hold is that of an Amazon Warehouse Associate - Seasonal. A job that could end at a moment's notice. I mention this background info to help understand how I'm trying to balance myself in this world. My job at Amazon is very hands-on, so the only other thing I can do to improve myself while at work is to listen to podcasts or audiobooks. Now I'm taking a very relaxed take on this. I don't listen to only tech stuff but sometimes music, TV shows, or movies. I don't want to burn myself out with so much information about tech and ultimately get bored of it.

One of the podcasts I listened to was from [CodeNewbie](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QAvT1wPq6bkQ9tLM1PQjr?si=972ab40e37984a82), this particular episode talked about how some people rely heavily on LinkedIn to get started with a career in tech. So I'm taking upon myself to improve my LinkedIn account and make it shine brighter than before. At least that is my task for today.

LinkedIn About Me:

```
At 34, I'm a seasoned software engineer driven by a lifelong curiosity for development. I began my journey to become a software engineer over a decade ago. To achieve this, I attended college and majored in Information Technology and Computer Science. However I did not manage to finish and get a degree in either. I've however received certificates from online bootcamps as a full-stack Web Developer, and I'm currently enrolled in Pursuit, pursuing the same goal.

My fascination with technology/development began when I was young, exploring the inner workings of computers and finding joy in understanding how everything works around me. This curiosity, coupled with my passion for tech, led me to pursue the knowledge needed to become a Software Engineer. Over the years, I've focused on programming languages such as JavaScript [6+ yrs], Java[3+ yrs], and Python [2+ yrs]. I enjoy sitting down and reviewing algorithm designs, researching how it all works and finding out why one solution would be more efficient than the other.

Enrolling in a bootcamp has shown me the power that peer coding holds; therefore, I understand and thrive in collaborative environments. They are key for continuous growth, not only for myself but others as well. Now, tech is not the only thing I'm about. I'm curious about a lot of things, and again, I love how everything in and outside this world works. Space is another guilty pleasure I have, how everything fits together in harmony or, in the case of a black hole, chaos. I'm constantly curious about how those events evolve.

This path I have chosen is an indication of my tireless passion for innovation and my unwavering drive to embrace new challenges. I'm not just a person trying to become a Software Engineer; I'm an explorer, trying to find balance and improvement in my skill set to ultimately create inventive solutions to real-world problems.

```

With the help of ChatGPT, I managed to come up with an About Me section that conveys what I am about. Although I used it for grammatical and spelling errors only, the AI changed multiple lines of my original text. This is a very curious issue that I wish to look into later on. As I am pressed for time at the moment, with work starting at 6 pm and the current time being 4:36 pm, I think I will look into that issue another day and blog about it. I believe what I'm doing here—blogging, researching, and taking things slow—is having the desired effect on me. I'm slowly feeling that there is balance here, not rushing things and enjoying the discovery of learning. After listening to many podcasts, I feel like I see a pattern from all the people being interviewed. They eventually burn out and lose that passion for what they went into tech for in the first place. I do not wish that to happen to me.

In the previous blog post I started reading articles that I bookmarked and saved for later. The particular article I choose was a very lengthy one and I feel that I need more time to complete it. For the same reason I'm explaning the burn out situation I do not want to rush into finishing a blog and doing a mediocre job on it.

> "Dreams without <i><strong>goals</strong></i> are just dreams. And ultimately they fuel <i><strong>dissappointment</strong></i>. On the road to <i><strong>achieving</strong></i> your dreams, you must apply <i><strong>discipline</strong></i>, but more importantly <i><strong>consistency</strong></i>. Without <i><strong>commitment</strong></i> you will never <i>start</i>, but without <i><strong>consistency</strong></i> you will never finish. - Denzel Washington

The quote above plus other factors in my life are what are currently given me this drive to keep pursuing my goal to eventually become a Software Engineer, but also be ready to accept if it doesn't happen.

## 12.05.23

After another long night shift at Amazon Fresh Warehouse, I didn't have much time for my studies. It's almost 5 PM, and I've got less than an hour to make progress. Let's review: I've learned a lot about algorithms, programming languages, and data structures, but I haven't actually used these skills yet. I think the next step to continuing my journey to become a Software Engineer is to start building. Working on my portfolio seems like the best way to get started. I not only need to show on paper what I know, but I need to actually build with what I know. A good portfolio should prove to employers that I've got the skills that they are looking for.

Programming Language:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript/Typescript

Potential Frontend Frameworks/Libraries

- React.js
- Next.js
- Vite.js

Version Control

- Git

Backend Technologies

- TBA

APIs

- [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/)

For now this seems like a good start. I will look into how to design it and deploy it later. The one thing that I have always had difficulty with is planning things out. With this new approach of writting blogs or I think at this point they are journal entries as the file name suggests, I think I have a better grasp and clear sight of my goals. If anyone is reading this thank you for sticking with me until now. I would like to think that there is someone out there as curious as me and going into people's repo and reading what they have.

### Uber Fellowship Program Rejection

Today, I received the news that the Uber Fellowship Program I interviewed for did not extend me an offer. This news hit me hard. It didn't hit me as hard as the rejection from the Google Fellowship Program, but it still hurt. As I'm writing this, I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about it. It's yet another rejection I must endure. You would think that by now I would have been accustomed to them, but I'm not. Maybe it's the feeling of desperation to start a career in Software Development before I'm in my 40s that's starting to creep into my psyche. Next year, I will be 35 years old, and I have yet to start a career in something I'm passionate about. My previous blogs talk about persistence, taking things slow, and accepting the things I cannot change, but with yet another rejection, the doubt in my mind resurfaces, and I wonder if I'm just in an uphill battle, one that I will certainly lose.

My body is tired from the physical labor I must endure at the Amazon Warehouse job I currently have. This I must do to provide for my family else we will certainly be in financial trouble once again. My mind is tired from all the things that I have to think about: Am I being a good father? Am I spending enough time with my kids? If I study on the days that I'm off, will that cause a rift in the relationship that I have with my kids? All these questions are the same when it comes to my wife. Although she has been there since day one and supports me in my efforts to pursue this goal of mine, I wonder if she is tired of it too. There are some days that it just gets to be too much, too much to handle.

I have the support. I have the resources to do what I must, which is study to eventually get a job in Software Engineering and keep working at Amazon to provide some financial stability for my family. I'm working on finding a balance between these and other parts of my life: father, husband, brother, and son. All these responsibilities, and I feel like I could explode at any minute, but I can't. I just can't lose control else everything that I've worked hard to build until now will come crashing down.

I need to believe that these journal entries are working and it's not just some gimmick that people say on podcasts to keep people busy. I have to believe that in the end, looking into myself and trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong and fixing it will eventually pay off. I will end this post with that, and I will try to restructure myself over the weekend.
