It's been over 10 years since I've started my journey to become a Software Engineer. I've pursued this goal through college education, online courses, participation in a coding bootcamp, and extensive self-studying. Despite all my efforts, breaking into this tech-world has proven to be a consistent challenge. To be completely transparent, over the years I have taken breaks pursuing this goal. One of these break periods occurred when the pandemic hit. The world as I knew it stopped dead in its tracks, it was at this point in time that I seized the chance to reassess and prioritize my own life. A family, that is what I wanted, my partner and I agreed that with the world stopping so briefly we could take the liberty to start having children. Once I started down that path, I needed to take the necessary steps to become independent and move out from my parent's home. I needed to create my own path at the age of 30.

When I attended college, I majored in Computer Science and Information Technology. It's cliché to say that I've always had a thing for technology, but there is no way around it. My parents got me a computer at the age of 5, and even though I don't remember the specific type they got for me, I do recall the very first game I played on it: Prince of Persia from 1989 (the year I was born). I feel I must include that Computer Science was not my very first choice. I started college back in 2008, majoring in Liberal Arts, and then switched to International Business. I didn't like either of them, and I was having too much fun with a fraternity I had just joined, which inevitably led me to abandon college altogether.

### Just a Programmer...

It's been two days since I've really sat down and worked on blogging about my journey to become a Software Engineer. In the previous blog, I gave a little background on how it all started and also provided a reason as to why it might be taking me so long to become one. I know that overall, if there are any faults, they lie with me. Writing these blogs has helped me to realize that now. But even so, I must pursue this goal of mine. I like to write code. I like peeping behind the veil of programs. I don't even know if that is the correct term for it. What makes them work? What breaks them? And ultimately, what makes them not break?

There are two core memories that are always replaying in my mind, and I feel I should share them here because they keep screaming at me that this is why you want to become a programmer. When I was a child, I don't remember exactly what toys I was playing with, but I do remember something my father said that still resonates with me to this day. It wasn't something negative, at least I don't think so. He said that I like to destroy things. I'd like to think that what he meant is: I like to deconstruct things to understand how they work from the inside out. I've constantly found myself tinkering with things whether it be in technology, life, or even within myself. What makes things work, think, act the way they do? What is the root cause of it all? Is there something in between cause and effect?

The second core memory would be when I was playing with clay. This was when I was visiting my native country, Peru. I believe I was trying to build a car out of clay with my cousins, and my aunt came in and mentioned that I was a 'detallista' [Spanish], a person that is detail-oriented. I remember her saying that because I was working on the inside of the car. The steering wheel, the pedals, and most of the front console. I wanted it to be like a real car, but smaller. I don't quite remember what my cousins were working on, but I do remember that my aunt came up to me and said that. This, combined with what my father said, has played a major role in my actions throughout life. When building a PC, I would stare at the motherboard and see how all the circuits connected with each other. Although I think everyone that builds a PC does this at some point, but I think I stared a little bit longer than most, just in awe of how it all came together.

I think I misspoke before about having two core memories because, as I am writing this, another core memory comes to mind —- one that is very dear to me because it involves cooking with my cousins. Again, this was back in Peru, but it was either around the same time as my previous memory or when I was a bit older. My cousins and I were in the kitchen preparing a Peruvian dish called "[Papa Rellena](https://perudelights.com/how-to-make-papa-rellena-step-by-step/)". This delicious dish requires for a light covering of flour before frying the potato. In my naive attempt to speed up the process, I added the flour to the mashed potato mixture all together. This led to my cousin telling me: 'How is the flour supposed to cook when it's in the mixture, when only the outside of the potato is going to be fried?' This is a core memory because I remember her telling me consistently not to do that. She ended the conversation by telling my aunt that 'I always do what I'm not supposed to,' or 'If someone tells me not to do something, I do it even more.' I hold on to this memory because it's true. I like to do the opposite of what others say. Two main reasons, though, and they are very true. One to find out for myself what would happen if I do it and the other to find out how people react to it or how I react to it afterward (there's that thing again about cause and effect). From what I can remember about myself, I've always been like this. I want to know what happens, why it happens, how it happens.

I'm writing this in the hopes that people will understand me better but most importantly I'm doing this to understand myself better and why I do the things that I do. Maybe I'm just meant to be a programmer on the side and not really become a Software Engineer with a job like everyone else. My journey has been long, with hurdles along the way, some of which I'm thankful for and some not. But I will keep pursuing this because it's something that I'm passionate about, I like it. Right now as, I'm thinking of how to write this my mind is telling me to write about how I view things while I'm driving. I'm constantly checking the mirrors and looking at the cars, measuring their speed and distance relative to mind, and constantly thinking how their trajectory might affect. Just watching the road and then seeing something slightly move out of place in the rearview mirror sends my mind into a spin of possibilities and options I have while driving. I'd like to think everyone is like this when driving but I might be wrong in that assumption. Even while at work I'm like this, I see one thing out of place and again my mind is sent into a whirlwind of possibilities good and bad. Therefore I must correct that issue otherwise my mind is stuck on that specific thing that must be fixed.

I think I will conclude this blog by mentioning that I was diagnosed with ADHD several years ago. Despite there being many different opinions on this medical condition, I like to believe that the things I do, say and how I think are entirely my own. They ultimately come from me and I'm responsible for them. I cannot with a clear conscious blame my struggles on a medical condition. At least that is not who I want to be. This realization comes from the many conversations I've had over the years with my wife and sister, whom I deeply love and appreciate. They've taken it upon themselves to really understand my medical condition and have always been there for me. My wife in particular, she's seen me at my most personal lowest moments, she's seen me break down and with her help, I've always managed to get back up. It's taken some time to terms with this, and it's even harder to write about this as I feel my eyes get watery, but even if I don't make it as a Software Engineer with a real job, I think I will be happy with myself to just be a programmer.

### What is HTMX?

Today's blog will focus on getting out of my comfort zone just a little:

Reading an article related to tech.

In my journey to become a well-rounded programmer, I've decided to take it upon myself to read an article about tech that I've previously bookmarked and read it. I find myself constantly bookmarking articles and telling myself I'll get back to them. But I never do, it's time to change that cycle. Doing this will force me to become a person of habit and discipline, something that I have been lacking. Doing this will deepen my understanding of the tech world, which, I believe, involves more than just writing code in front of the computer.

So lets begin, the article is:

[Why you should choose HTMX for your next project](https://dev.to/turculaurentiu91/why-you-should-choose-htmx-for-your-next-project-o7j) by [Turcu Laurentiu](https://github.com/turculaurentiu91)

The author starts by claiming that HTMX can be considered as a replacement for React. Since React is the only JavaScript library I have tinkered with the title of this article peaked my interest.

Let's start by finding out what is [HTMX](https://refine.dev/blog/what-is-htmx/)?

- HTMX is a modern JavaScript Library that allows us to have seamless client-server communication.
- HTMX also simplifies the behavior of web pages by allowing them to update their content dynamically.
- HTMX uses specific HTML attributes to define how elements on a particular webpage interact with the server.
