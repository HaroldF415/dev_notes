# Lesson - 1

## Intro to React.js

- Explain what React is and why it is used
- Explain why React is a library and not a framework
- Explain the difference between React and other frameworks
- Explain the difference between React and other libraries
- Explain the difference between React and other tools
- Brief overview of the concepts and principles behind React, such as component-based architecture and virtual DOM

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook, and it's widely used in modern web development. React allows developers to build complex and dynamic user interfaces in a modular and reusable way. It's a very popular library and you can find it used in many websites and web applications such as Facebook, Instagram, and Netflix.

React uses a concept called "components" to build the user interface. A component is a piece of code that represents a part of the user interface, such as a button, a form, or a card. Components can be reused multiple times throughout the application, and they can even be nested inside other components. This makes React applications easy to maintain and scale.

React also uses a technique called "virtual DOM" to optimize the performance of updates and changes in the user interface. The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) and React uses it to determine the minimal number of changes needed to be made to the UI, this makes the updates faster and more efficient.

We will start with setting up the development environment and creating a new React application using Create React App, and then move on to learning about components, props, state, and other concepts in React. Feel free to ask questions along the way, and I'll be happy to help you with any issues you may encounter.

Let's start by installing Node.js and create-react-app, it's a tool that makes it easy to create a new React application. This is the first step for starting to learn React.

## Setting up a React Development Environment

- Explain what Node.js is and why it is used
- Explain what npm is and why it is used
- Explain what create-react-app is and why it is used
- Explain how to create a new React application using create-react-app
- Explain how to run a React application in development mode
- Explain how to build a React application for production

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. It's a very popular tool and it's used in many modern web applications. Node.js comes with a package manager called npm, which is used to install and manage dependencies for Node.js applications.
