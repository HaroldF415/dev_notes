# An Eternal Golden Braid

## 9.29.2023

Today I started to read:

Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.

While reading the preface of this book the author seems not happy on how people view this book so in a sentence that seems to be the "core focus" of the book he writes:

"In a word, GEB is a very personal attemp to say how it is that animate beings can come out of inanimate matter."

## Vocabulary List

- Animate: it refers to the action of making something living, usually something that was previously inanimate.

- Inanimate: it refers to objects, things, or entities that lack life or living qualities. Inanimate objects do not possess the characteristics of living organisms, such as the ability to grow, reproduce, respond to stimuli, or carry out metabolic processes.
